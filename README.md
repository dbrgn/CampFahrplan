This is a fork from [ligi's CampFahrplan](https://github.com/ligi/CampFahrplan) app for 33C3. It has been slightly adapted for ZeTeCo 2017.

I'll probably prepare an APK and upload it here before the ZeTeCo starts. Distribution via Play Store or F-Droid is too complicated ATM :)

To build a debug version:

    $ ./gradlew build

To install debug version to a device:

    $ ./gradlew installZetecoDebug

This was a fork from [tuxmobils FahrPlan](http://github.com/tuxmobil/campfahrplan) application for [33C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Main_Page) purposes. This **fork is not active anymore** - please **head over** to [confi](https://github.com/ligi/confi) for the next iteration
